MVC -> Model View Controller

Whenever we go to a restaurant
1. Sit on table and choose items from the menu
2. You tell your order to waiter
3. Waiter goes to chef/cook and asks to make the items
4. Cook will go to storage, bring out the raw materials and cook the food
5. Once cooked, waiter will bring to you

Journey on a website :
1. You get choose or request from a lot of options on UI -> VIEW
2. Waiter -> Controller -> which accepts request and returns a response

Controller -> which is the first entry point of a request


3. Model -> represent the storage

Bonus point -> Kitchen and the cook represent the service/repository layer. [Business logic]

FE code|       Backend Code
UI <-> Controller <-> Service <-> Repository <-> Database
       accepts req    business    talks to DB    stores the data
       return resp    logic
       validation
       auth and author

# What is the difference between Spring MVC and Spring Boot ?
MVC -> Single codebase contains -> both UI code[web-inf] and backend code, it
contains a deployment descriptor

Boot -> contains only backend codebase[tweaking for UI is possible]
